# libctm
 everybody edits, yeah, the game you see
 btw libctm stands for:
 **LIB**rary **C**ompact **T**ile **M**ap
 
also im aware that i can use CMake, i tried but it just throws me a billion errors that i have no idea how to fix, because i have never used CMake before
- or just drop CMake and learn meson instead

ANYWAY meanwhile heres a **.cbp** project file, just get code::blocks and github desktop if you wanna (unlikely) contribute
